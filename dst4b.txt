I took an embedded systems course as an undergraduate which I subsequently TA'd for. I have lots of experience with the MSP430 and UART interface, and have designed an MSP430-based embedded system for a Rubik's cube solving robot w/ USB interface to a PC GUI. My undergrad research focused on implementing a custom tool flow for programming/testing/debugging an MSP430 ASIC. Programming languages that I've used that are most relevant to embedded design are C,C++,MIPS assembly, and MSP430 assembly. I have very limited experience with TCL/Perl.
My current research is in low-power IC/SoC design, motivated towards IoT applications. I think that having a good understanding of embedded design will give me better planning abilities and design insights as an SoC designer. In this class, I hope to learn more about planning/design of embedded architecture, IO and memory interfacing, and learn more about the software development side of embedded systems, e.g., open-source/GNU tools for compiling and debugging, JTAG, etc.
