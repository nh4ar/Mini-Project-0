I have taken Introduction to Embedded Computing Systems, the Fundamentals courses, Digital Signal Processing, and other software classes, in a variety of languages including Python, C, and C++. I am also studying music and work in the Architecture School's Fabricaion Lab, and I have worked on software and hardware projects in each on platforms like the Raspberry Pi, Arduino family, and JUCE Plugin Framework. 

I'm very interested in CPS and IoT, and have recently gotten interested in the maker movements and designing my own embedded systems. In addition, I'm pursuing a capstone project that would require integration of a variety of sensors and processors into a robust embedded system. This class would give me more experience as I attempt other endeavors!
